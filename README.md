### Welcome to my Github!
I'm Nate. I am a student in the [MS in Computer Science Align program](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/align-masters-of-science-in-computer-science/) at Northeastern University in Boston, MA and am on track to graduate this May 2023. Here are a few of the projects that I have completed throughout my time as an MSCS student:

#### Art Collection Website - [Client Repo](https://github.com/nziegler87/CS5610-Art-Collector-Website) and [Server Repo](https://github.com/nziegler87/CS5610-Art-Collector-Website-Server)
- Designed and deployed a full-stack single-page web application using React.js, Boostrap, Node.js, and MongoDB
- Created responsive component-based interface that supported user login and session
- Developed MongoDB schemas to store user information, for sale/swap listings, and transaction history 
- Wrote RESTful API enpoints to support basic CRUD operations of data store within MongoDB
- Integrated calls to 3rd-party WikiArt API to supplement data returned via self-written RESTful APIs

#### [Shortest Path for MBTA Network](https://github.com/tolliverdani/CS5800-Shortest-Path-on-the-MBTA)
- Applied Dikjstra's shortest path between two stations on the MBTA
- Created two versions of the algorith, one that uses a loop and a second that uses a min-heap, to compare runtime differences
- Retrieved station data from the MBTA API and combined it with bus line data from a CSV file
- Implemented a custom graph structure with adjacency lists to represent the stations and connections within the network

#### [Design and Implementation of Relational Database to Store FAA Birdstrike Data](https://github.com/nziegler87/CS5200-Design-Implement-Relational-Database)
- Designed and implemented a relational database schema (BCNF) to store FAA birdstrike data that was read from a CSV file
- Cleaned, transformed, and uploaded the data to an AWS RDS using RStudio

#### [Design and Realize an Relational Database and Star Schema](https://github.com/nziegler87/CS5200-Realize-Relational-Database-and-Star-Schema)
- Created a relational database schema (BCNF) to store medical journal publication information that was loaded from a XML file
- Designed and implmented a Star Schema to provide quick analysis of data in the relational database
- Parsed the XML file then cleaned, transformed, and uploaded the data to an AWS RDS using RStudio

### Welcome to my Github!
I'm Nate. I am a student in the [MS in Computer Science Align program](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/align-masters-of-science-in-computer-science/) at Northeastern University in Boston, MA and am on track to graduate this May 2023. Here are a few of the projects that I have completed throughout my time as an MSCS student:

### [Art Collection Website](https://friendly-longma-f9c0b7.netlify.app/) - [Client Repo](https://github.com/nziegler87/CS5610-Art-Collector-Website) and [Servero Repo](https://github.com/nziegler87/CS5610-Art-Collector-Website-Server)

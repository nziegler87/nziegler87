### Welcome to my Github!
I'm Nate. I am a student in the [MS in Computer Science Align program](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/align-masters-of-science-in-computer-science/) at Northeastern University in Boston, MA and am on track to graduate this May 2023. Here are a few of the projects that I have completed throughout my time as an MSCS student:

#### [Art Collection Website](https://friendly-longma-f9c0b7.netlify.app/) - [Client Repo](https://github.com/nziegler87/CS5610-Art-Collector-Website) and [Server Repo](https://github.com/nziegler87/CS5610-Art-Collector-Website-Server)
- Designed and deployed a full-stack single-page web application using React.js, Boostrap, Node.js, and MongoDB
- Created responsive component-based interface that supported user login and session
- Developed MongoDB schemas to store user information, for sale/swap listings, and transaction history 
- Wrote RESTful API enpoints to support basic CRUD operations of data store within MongoDB
- Integrated calls to 3rd-party WikiArt API to supplement data returned via self-written RESTful APIs
